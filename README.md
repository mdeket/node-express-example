# node-express-example


# Node.js w/ Express.js and Mongodb

## Introduction

Example app for anyone who is a beginner with these technologies.

I've added babel watch so you wouldn't have to restart you server after every change. Just refresh the page to load the new changes.

## Installation

Node - 8.5 (used for dev)

Just run ``` yarn install ```(recommended) or ``` npm install ``` to download all dependencies needed to run the app. After that hit ``` npm start ``` and the app will be server on **localhost:3000**.

Download mongodb from this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community). Well the installation part you will have to figure out on your own (there is a lot of instructions on the internet, just google it out).
